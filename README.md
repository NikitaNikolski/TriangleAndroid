TriangleAndroid
===============
In this project, we show how to:
- Use vertex buffer objects (VBOs) to define a triangle’s vertex positions and colors, and update the VBO every frame to animate the triangle.
- Write a GLSL ES shader to display the triangle.
- Extract the shader files from the applications’s assets using native methods.
